# Horoscope
To get better in python programming, I made a Horoscope.
When you start the script, it'll ask you for your zodiac sign.
You have to type in your zodiac sign (doesn't matter if your type it like "Aquarius" or "aquarius")
After your typed it in, it will tell you facts about your zodiac signs and traits like Strenghts, Weaknesses, etc.

When the script told your the facts and traits, it asks you, if you want to read more about it.
If you want to you can type in "Yes" or "yes" it gives you a link to a website where I got all these facts. You can read much more about 
your zodiac sign on this website.
But you can also type "No" or "no" and it'll just stop.

If you type in a not available zodiac sign, you get an error and it says "Type in an available zodiac sign"


Im pretty sure, theres a way where you can do this much easier. But this is my way and I'm proud my second project is 237 lines.
